        This static website made by @emrhnpla02 in 1 day. This is not a personal
        website, just some kind of a linktree alternative but only i can use
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually i started this project to make a alternative website to
        linktree or something like that but when it comes to responsive design
        and other boring stuffs... i was bored then i decided to make this
        website static and only for me. Here is the result! Fuck fontawesome.com
        btw. How a icon library doesn't have matrix.org, lemmy.ml and odysee.com
        even and even EPICGAMES.COM icons?!?!!..? Anyway how are you today?
