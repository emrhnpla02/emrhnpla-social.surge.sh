        Actually i started this project to make a alternative website to
        linktree or something like that but when it comes to responsive design
        and other boring stuffs... i was bored then i decided to make this
        website static and only for me. Here is the result! Fuck fontawesome.com
        btw. How a icon library doesn't have matrix.org, lemmy.ml and odysee.com
        even and even EPICGAMES.COM icons?!?!!..? Anyway how are you today?

        reasons. i don't use reddit as much as i used to anyway.
